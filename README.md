# WEBP-to-PNG
The tkinter library in Python was used for the very basic GUI. 
When ran, the application will display a window with a label and a button that allows the user to select a file. The user can select a file with the '.webp' extension and then press a button to convert the selected file to a '.png' file. The converted file will be saved in the user's downloads folder.

The select_file() function is called when the user clicks the "Select File" button, and it opens a file selection dialog that allows the user to select a '.webp' file. The convert() function is called when the user clicks the "Convert" button, and it uses the convert_webp_to_png() function to convert the selected '.webp' file to a '.png' file, saving the converted file in the user's downloads folder. Finally, a message box is displayed to the user indicating that the conversion is complete.
